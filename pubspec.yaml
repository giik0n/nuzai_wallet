# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
     - assets/icons/Logo.png
     - assets/icons/google.png
     - assets/icons/facebook.png
     - assets/icons/loading.png

     - assets/icons/triangle.png

     - assets/icons/metamask_icon.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: Montserrat
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-SemiBold.ttf
           weight: 700
     - family: Fredoka
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/Fredoka.ttf
